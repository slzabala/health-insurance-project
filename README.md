Project 3 Challenge

Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze and visualize patterns and uncover trends in health insurance claims data by analyzing multiple variables. 

Objectives:
This project will focus on the following goals:
1.    Explore and Analyze Claims Data
2.    Uncover Claims Key Trends
3.    Highlight Claims Data Outliers 
4.    Use of Interactive Visualizations 

Datasets:
•    The datasets are publicly available health insurance claims. 
•    The datasets contain over 100 unique records.
Medical Claim Charges Dataset: 
The first dataset was retrieved from Kaggle’s public datasets and provides demographics and Medical Insurance Cost for a small sample of the U.S.A. population. This Data is practical and is used in the book Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz; which is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R.

CMS Claims Denials Dataset:
The second dataset was retrieved from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) who are committed to increasing transparency in the Health Insurance Exchanges.

Research Questions: 
1.    How do claim charges vary by demographic factors (age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and region)?
2.    Which states or regions have the highest claim charges and denial rates, and how do they compare across regions?
3.    What is the impact of smoking status and BMI on claim charges or denial rates?
4.    Which states or regions have the highest claim charges and denial rates, and what demographic factors contributes to this?
5.    Which state or region has the highest rate of appeals and appeals overturned? 

Tools and Technologies:
•    Programing Languages: Python
    -Pandas, US Library, Seaborn
•    Data Cleaning: Pandas, NumPy
•    Visualization Libraries: Plotly, Seaborn
o    Example Visualizations: Bar charts, line charts and geographical maps. 
•    Database: SQLite
•    JavaScript Libraries: D3.js(v7), Plotly.js, Bootstrap
o    Styling: Bootstrap CSS


Files:
Resources Folder containts the original data sets. 
Jupyter Notebook EDA file is health_insurance_claims_EDA.ipynb
Database: insurance.db
Assests Folder contains a json folder for a json folder coding the visualizations and a js folder with a json folder with the raw data. 

Ethical Considerations: 
    Anonymizing Data and reducing bias

Data Privacy: 
Made sure the data did not contain any identifiable patient health information (PHI) to remain compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPA).

Transparency:
Made sure data sources were ethically collected and made it accessible in my research. 

Avoid misinterpretation or misuse:
Further decision affecting policies or practice should caution and perform additional research, context and qualitative analysis.  The main purpose of this analysis was to inform but not change any real policies or practice. 

 Ethical Implications: 
Both datasets were obtained legally and from reputable sources.
